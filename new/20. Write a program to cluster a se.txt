 20. Write a program to cluster a set of points using K-means for IRIS
 dataset. Consider, K=3, clusters. Consider Euclidean distance as the
 distance measure. Randomly initialize a cluster mean as one of the data
 points. Iterate at least for 10 iterations. After iterations are over, print the
 final cluster means for each of the clusters.

code:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(r"E:\TY\DSML_dataset\IRIS.csv")

X = df.iloc[:, 0:4].values    # Only numeric features

np.random.seed(42)  # for reproducibility

K = 3
n_points = X.shape[0]


initial_indices = np.random.choice(n_points, K, replace=False)
means = X[initial_indices]

def euclidean_distance(a, b):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((a - b)**2))

for iter in range(10):
    # Step 1: Assign each point to nearest centroid
    clusters = [[] for _ in range(K)]
    for point in X:
        distances = [euclidean_distance(point, center) for center in means]
        cluster_idx = np.argmin(distances)
        clusters[cluster_idx].append(point)
    
    # Step 2: Recompute centroid as mean of cluster points
    for i in range(K):
        if len(clusters[i]) > 0:
            means[i] = np.mean(clusters[i], axis=0)
        # If a cluster gets no points, keep its centroid unchanged

print("Final cluster means after 10 iterations:")
for i, center in enumerate(means):
    print(f"Cluster {i+1} centroid:\n {center}")
